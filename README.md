3 - Delete the files "sz3ud.03c" and "sz3ud.04c" and then rename "sz3udi.03c" to "sz3ud.03c" and rename "sz3udi.04c" to "sz3ud.04c"

4 - Apply the SFA3CE IPS patches from the "graphics" and "unencrypted" folders to the ROMs that match their file names. For Alpha 3 branding, use the IPS files in the "sfa3ce" folder. For Zero 3 branding, use the IPS files in the "sfz3ce" folder.

5 - Zip the contents of your patched from folder and rename it to "sfa3ud.zip"

6 - Put it in your MAME ROM directory. You might want to keep a separate installation of MAME for hacks so that they won't contaminate a clean ROM set.
